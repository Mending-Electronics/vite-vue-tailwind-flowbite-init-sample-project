Flowbite Vue - Quickstart
Get started with Flowbite by including it into your project using NPM

Flowbite is a library of components built on top of the utility-classes from Tailwind CSS and it also includes a JavaScript file that makes interactive elements works, such as modals, dropdowns, and more. Learn how to get started by following this quickstart guide.


âœ… What You Should Do First

Make sure that you have Node.js installed. Flowbite Vue requires version 18 or newer.
node -v



Before installing dependencies, you need to initialize a Node.js project. Here's how:

```bash
npm init vite@latest
```

This command will prompt you to choose a project name and framework (select Vue). It will scaffold the project structure for you.

Then:

```bash
cd your-project-name
npm install
```


Install and configure TailwindCSS
Install Tailwind CSS as part of devDependencies:

npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/vite
Configure the Vite plugin:

update vite.config.js
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'
import tailwindcss from '@tailwindcss/vite'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    vue(),
    tailwindcss(),
  ],
})
```

Import Tailwind CSS

create a `src/style.css`

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
```
INFO

Remember to @reference your main style in <style> blocks if you want to use directives from Tailwind CSS.

update the App.vue `<style>` element
```vue
<style scoped>
@reference "./style.css";

.custom-class {
  @apply border rounded p-3;
}
</style>
```

update the main.js file to import and use the `style.css` file whoe embed tailwind
```js
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import './style.css'

createApp(App).mount('#app')
```


Install and configure Flowbite Vue
Install Flowbite and Flowbite Vue as part of dependencies:

```bash
npm i flowbite flowbite-vue
```

Update `src/style.css` file

```css
/* import Flowbite Vue styles */
@import "flowbite-vue/index.css";

/* import Flowbite plugin */
@plugin "flowbite/plugin";

/* add Flowbite Vue directory using @source directive */
@source "../node_modules/flowbite-vue";
```

Now you can use Flowbite Vue anywhere in your project and build awesome interfaces:

update the `<script setup>` element in your vue component
use flowbite css & js components in your vue components

```vue
<template>
  <fwb-alert type="success">
    Success! You can now use Flowbite Vue in your Vue application ðŸŽ‰
  </fwb-alert>
</template>

<script setup>
import { FwbAlert } from 'flowbite-vue'
</script>
```
